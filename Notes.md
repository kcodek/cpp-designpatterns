# **SOLID**

## Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should only have one reason to change
* *Separation of concerns*  - different classes handling different, independent tasks/ problems

## Open-Close Principle

- Classes should be open form extension but closed for modification

## Liskov Substitution Principle
* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

## Interface Segregation Principle
- Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces
- YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

## Dependency Inversion Principle
* High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstractions
